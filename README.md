# Whiteout Survival Gift Code Redemption Script

Python script that automates the process of redeeming gift codes in the game **Whiteout Survival**. It reads a list of Player IDs from one or more `.csv` files, automatically attempts to solve the CAPTCHA required by the API using a selected OCR method, sends requests to the game's giftcode redemption API, and redeems the specified gift code for each player.

It was built with the goal of providing an alternative to [the Discord Bot](https://github.com/whiteout-project/bot) that I'm also helping develop. Setting up the bot and hosting it can take some effort to do, while this script can be run with one simple command. It can also be seen as providing a kind of backup option when your Discord bot is down and redemption is failing. The bot is awesome though - check it out if you haven't already.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Ensure Python is added to your system's PATH during installation.
2.  **Core Libraries**: Install the base libraries required by the script:
    ```bash
    pip install requests opencv-python numpy pillow colorama
    ```
3.  **Optional OCR Libraries**: Install **at least one** of the following based on the `--ocr-method` you intend to use:
    *   **For `ddddocr` (Recommended Default, ~80% Success Rate, Lightweight):**
        ```bash
        pip install ddddocr==1.5.6 --ignore-requires-python
        ```
        *(Note: --ignore-requires-python is required to support Python 3.13 and beyond)*

    *   **For `easyocr`(~40-50% Success Rate, Heavy Requirements):**
        ```bash
        pip install easyocr torch torchvision torchaudio
        ```
        *(Note: `torch` install might vary based on your system/CUDA version if using GPU. See GPU section below. This installs PyTorch for CPU.)*

    *   **For `captchacracker` *(~40-50% Success Rate, Moderate Requirements):**
        ```bash
        pip install captchacracker
        ```
        *(Note: This will install `tensorflow`. You also need the `model/weights.h5` file placed correctly relative to the script. This method might encounter TensorFlow/DLL installation issues.)*

---

## Setup

1.  **Get the Script**:
    *   Clone the repository or download the `redeem_codes.py` script.
    *   If using `captchacracker`, ensure you have cloned the repository or downloaded the `weights.h5` file that is included in the `model` directory alongside the script.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Run the `pip install ...` commands listed in the **Prerequisites** section above for the core libraries and *at least one* optional OCR library. Use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (`venv`) to manage dependencies cleanly.
    *   If you just want to use the default method (recommended), run: 
    ```
    pip install requests opencv-python-headless numpy pillow colorama ddddocr==1.5.6 --ignore-requires-python
    ```
3.  **Prepare the CSV File(s)**:
    *   Create one or more `.csv` files (e.g., `player_ids.csv`).
    *   **Format**: One ID per line OR comma-separated IDs are supported.
    *   Place the `.csv` file(s) in the same directory as the script, or note the full path.

4.  **Run the Script**: see below.

---

## Usage

Run the script from your command line or terminal using `python`:

```bash
python redeem_codes.py --code <gift_code> [--csv <path_or_pattern>] [--ocr-method <method>] [--save-images <mode>] [--use-gpu [id]]
```

### Arguments

-   `--code`: **Required**. The gift code you want to redeem (e.g., `WOS2025`).
-   `--csv`: Specifies the player ID source. Defaults to checking the current directory if not provided. Can be:
    *   A path to a single `.csv` file.
    *   A path to a folder/directory containing `.csv` files.
    *   The pattern `*.csv` (ensure quotes if needed by your shell) or `.` to process all `.csv` files in the script's directory.
-   `--ocr-method`: Selects the OCR engine. Choices depend on installed libraries (e.g., `ddddocr`, `easyocr`, `captchacracker`). Defaults to `ddddocr` if available.
-   `--save-images <mode>`: Controls saving captcha images to the `captcha_images` folder.
    *   `0`: None (Default)
    *   `1`: Failed CAPTCHAs only (OCR failure or server rejection)
    *   `2`: Successful CAPTCHAs only (Passed server validation)
    *   `3`: All CAPTCHAs
-   `--use-gpu [id]`: Enable GPU. Primarily affects `easyocr`. Optionally specify a PyTorch device ID (e.g., `--use-gpu 0`, `--use-gpu 1`). `ddddocr`/`captchacracker` might auto-detect.

### Examples

*   **Process a gift code for all `.csv` files (using default `ddddocr`):**
    ```bash
    python redeem_codes.py --code ILoveWOS
    ```

*   **Process a specific `ids.csv`:**
    ```bash
    python redeem_codes.py --code ILoveWOS --csv ids.csv
    ```

*   **Process all `.csv` files in the current folder using `easyocr`:**
    ```bash
    python redeem_codes.py --code ILoveWOS --ocr-method easyocr
    ```

*   **Process all `.csv` files with `ddddocr`, saving only successfully validated captcha images:**
    ```bash
    python redeem_codes.py --code ILoveWOS --csv *.csv --ocr-method ddddocr --save-images 2
    ```

*   **Process with `easyocr` using a specific GPU (e.g., discrete GPU with ID 1):**
    ```bash
    python redeem_codes.py --code ILoveWOS --csv all_ids.csv --ocr-method easyocr --use-gpu 1
    ```

## Features

-   **Multiple OCR Options**: Choose between different OCR engines:
    -   `ddddocr` (Recommended Default): Lightweight, fast, and generally effective for this type of captcha.
    -   `easyocr`: More robust OCR, potentially slower, offers GPU acceleration via PyTorch.
    -   `captchacracker`: Another model-based approach (requires TensorFlow).
        > **Note:** The `captchacracker` method requires specific model files (`model/weights.h5`) and a better model will be trained in the future. **`ddddocr` is the recommended method.**
-   **Flexible CSV Import**: Reads player IDs from `.csv` files. Supports **both** formats:
    -   One player ID per line.
    -   Multiple player IDs on a single line, separated by commas (whitespace is ignored).
-   **Automatic CAPTCHA Solving**: Uses the selected OCR method to automatically read and submit CAPTCHA codes required by the redemption API.
-   **Command-Line Interface**: Accepts the `.csv` file path (or a directory, or `*.csv`), gift code, and OCR method as arguments.
-   **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for missing/invalid inputs, API responses, and CAPTCHA failures.
-   **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests when the server indicates temporary issues (e.g., `TIMEOUT RETRY`) or CAPTCHA errors.
-   **Verbose Logging**: Shows timestamp, player nickname (if available) & ID consistently. Logs all output to a file (`redeemed_codes.txt`). Console output is colored for readability (requires `colorama`).
-   **CAPTCHA Image Saving**: Optionally saves CAPTCHA images to a folder (`captcha_images`) based on success/failure modes (`--save-images` flag).
-   **GPU Acceleration**: Optional GPU support primarily for `easyocr` (via PyTorch), with specific device selection.
-   **Summary Report**: Provides a summary of successful redemptions, already redeemed codes, errors, and detailed OCR/captcha statistics at the end, broken down by method used.

## GPU Support

GPU acceleration can speed up OCR processing, particularly for `easyocr`. The `--use-gpu` flag primarily targets `easyocr`'s PyTorch backend.

### How GPU Support Works

-   `easyocr` uses PyTorch. The `--use-gpu [id]` flag tells PyTorch which CUDA device ID to use. For NVIDIA GPU you can find the device ID using the `nvidia-smi` command.
-   `ddddocr` uses ONNX Runtime. It can potentially use `CUDAExecutionProvider` or `DmlExecutionProvider` (DirectML on Windows) if available and compatible ONNX Runtime packages are installed. This usually happens automatically.
-   `captchacracker` uses TensorFlow. TensorFlow typically auto-detects and uses compatible GPUs (CUDA).

### Setting Up NVIDIA GPU Support for EasyOCR

1.  **Install NVIDIA Drivers**: Ensure you have the latest drivers for your GPU.
2.  **Install CUDA Toolkit**: (Optional, often handled by PyTorch/TensorFlow install). If needed, install a compatible version (e.g., 11.8, 12.1) from NVIDIA's website.
3.  **Install PyTorch with CUDA support**: Use the command generator on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the correct `pip install` command corresponding to your OS and desired CUDA version. Example for CUDA 11.8:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```
4.  **Verify PyTorch GPU setup**: You could use the script `verify_gpu.py` included in this repository to verify GPU support.
    ```python
    python verify_gpu.py
    ```
    You will also see the main script output inform you if the GPU device is being used.

### Setting Up AMD GPU Support (ROCm for EasyOCR/PyTorch)

Support is more limited and depends on OS/GPU/ROCm version compatibility. Follow official ROCm and PyTorch guides.

### Using the Script with GPU Support

-   Use `--use-gpu` or `--use-gpu <id>` when running with `--ocr-method easyocr`.
-   For `ddddocr` or `captchacracker`, GPU usage is typically automatic if dependencies are installed correctly; the `--use-gpu` flag will not have any effect.

### Logging

All console output (without color codes) is automatically appended to a log file named `redeemed_codes.txt` in the script folder.

If `--save-images` is set to 1, 2, or 3, a folder named `captcha_images` will be created to save captcha images.

---

## Troubleshooting

1.  **`pip` command not found**: Ensure Python is installed correctly and in PATH.
2.  **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure you've installed the core libraries (`requests`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `colorama`) and at least *one* of the required OCR libraries (`ddddocr`, `easyocr`, `captchacracker`) in your active Python environment/venv. Check for install errors.
3.  **`ddddocr` / `onnxruntime` Issues**: `ddddocr` relies on `onnxruntime`. Errors during `ddddocr` initialization might stem from `onnxruntime` problems (missing DLLs, incompatible CPU instructions). Ensure `onnxruntime` installed correctly.
4.  **`captchacracker` / `tensorflow` Issues**: This method depends heavily on a correct TensorFlow installation, which can be complex (CPU vs GPU versions, CUDA/cuDNN dependencies, DLL issues, Python version compatibility). If the script fails to import `CaptchaCracker`, try importing `tensorflow` directly in a Python interpreter within the venv to diagnose. Ensure the `model/weights.h5` file exists.
5.  **`easyocr` / `torch` Issues**: Ensure PyTorch and its dependencies (`torchvision`, `torchaudio`) are installed correctly, matching your system (CPU/CUDA version).
6.  **CSV File Not Found**: Verify the `--csv` path.
7.  **Permission Denied (Log File / CAPTCHA Folder)**: Check write permissions.
8.  **Code Expired / Claim Limit Reached**: Verify the gift code.
9.  **API Rate Limiting / `TIMEOUT RETRY`**: Increase `DELAY` in the script if needed.
10. **CAPTCHA Solving Failures (`CAPTCHA CHECK ERROR`, etc.)**:
    *   The selected OCR method might be struggling. Try a different one (`--ocr-method`). `ddddocr` is generally recommended first.
    *   If using `easyocr`, ensure it's installed correctly and consider trying GPU acceleration.
    *   Check saved failed images (`--save-images 1` or `3`) to see if the captcha is readable. The API might have changed captcha style.
11. **GPU Issues**:
    *   Verify CUDA/ROCm setup and matching PyTorch/TensorFlow versions.
    *   Try different device IDs with `--use-gpu`.
    *   Run without `--use-gpu` to test CPU fallback.
